This project demonstrates an understanding of how to add DOM elements to a page via javascript, as well
as how to use event listeners to trigger changes on a web page.
Through the addition of the shading features and color randomization, I also got to learn a lot about how
colors are formatted and how to do different color-type conversions (though not all of those conversions ended 
up being necessary in the final program.)
